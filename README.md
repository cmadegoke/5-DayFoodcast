# 5-DayFoodcast
This project is a weather forecast with suggested recipes based on the weather (i.e. rain, snow, sun, or overcast conditions)<lb>
We set the APIs to work in the order of the weather pulls from location and the recipes pull from the weather<lb>
We have the header at the top of the page showing the title, icon, and location search bar<lb>
Below that would show two columns side-by-side, each containing 5 rows:<lb> 
    The column on the left would include the weather information (i.e. weather icon, temperature, and date) with the current date emphasized (bolded)<lb>
    The column on the right would include the picture of the food, prep time, and calorie count for whatever is too be made<lb>
